 Given a set of time intervals in any order, merge all overlapping intervals into one and output the result which should have only mutually 
 exclusive intervals. Let the intervals be represented as pairs of integers for simplicity. 

For example, let the given set of intervals be {{1,3}, {2,4}, {5,7}, {6,8} }. The intervals {1,3} and {2,4} overlap with each other,
 so they should be merged and become {1, 4}. Similarly {5, 7} and {6, 8} should be merged and become {5, 8}

56. Merge Intervals
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

 Method 1:- A simple approach is to start from the first interval and compare it with all other intervals for overlapping, if it overlaps with
            any other interval, then remove the other interval from list and merge the other into the first interval. Repeat the same steps for
            remaining intervals after first. This approach cannot be implemented in better than O(n^2) time.
 
 Method 2:- An efficient approach is to first sort the intervals according to starting time. Once we have the sorted intervals, we can combine 
            all intervals in a linear traversal. The idea is, in sorted array of intervals, if interval[i] doesnâ€™t overlap with interval[i-1], 
            then interval[i+1] cannot overlap with interval[i-1] because starting time of interval[i+1] must be greater than or equal to interval[i].
            Following is the detailed step by step algorithm.

			1. Sort the intervals based on increasing order of 
			    starting time.
			2. Push the first interval on to a stack.
			3. For each interval do the following
			   a. If the current interval does not overlap with the stack top, push it.
			   b. If the current interval overlaps with stack top and ending time of current interval is more than that of stack top, 
			       update stack top with the ending  time of current interval.
			4. At the end stack contains the merged intervals.

complexity :- Time complexity of the method is O(nLogn) which is for sorting. Once the array of intervals is sorted, merging takes linear time.
			  solution requires O(n) extra space for stack.

Method 3:-  We can avoid use of extra space by doing merge operations in-place. Below are detailed steps.

			1) Sort all intervals in decreasing order of start time.
			2) Traverse sorted intervals starting from first interval, 
			   do following for every interval.
			      a) If current interval is not first interval and it 
			         overlaps with previous interval, then merge it with
			         previous interval. Keep doing it while the interval
			         overlaps with the previous one.         
			      b) Else add current interval to output list of intervals.
			      
Note:-  That if intervals are sorted by decreasing order of start times, we can quickly check if intervals overlap or not by comparing
 start time of previous interval with end time of current interval.
