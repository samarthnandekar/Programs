 There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green.
 The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses
 have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting
house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
