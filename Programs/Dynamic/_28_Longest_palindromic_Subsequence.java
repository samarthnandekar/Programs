  Longest Palindromic Subsequence
  Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it.
 
 Example:- Geeksforgeeks   output:- 5
 
 longest palindromic subsequence we can get is of length 5. There are more than palindromic subsequences of length 5.
 For example.. EEKEE,EESEE,EE
 
 As another example, if the given sequence is “BBABCBCAB”, then the output should be 7 as “BABCBAB” is the longest palindromic 
 subseuqnce in it. “BBBBB” and “BBCBB” are also palindromic subsequences of the given sequence, but not the longest ones.
 
 
 ****** it is different from longest palindromic substring ********
 
 0 1 2 3 4 5
 a g b d b a
 
 ans:- abdba
