 Maximum sum such that no two elements are adjacent 
 Given an array of positive numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence
 should be adjacent in the array. So 3 2 7 10 should return 13 (sum of 3 and 10) or 3 2 5 10 7 should return 15 (sum of 3, 5 and 7).

Examples:
Input :  arr[] = {3, 5, 3} 
Output : 6 

Explanation : Selecting indexes 0 and 2 will maximise the sum 
i.e 3+3 = 6
Input : arr[] = {2, 5, 2}
Output : 5

 198. House Robber
 You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed,
 the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and 
 it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

Example 2:
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

             
 213. House Robber II    https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/
 You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place
 are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected 
 and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
