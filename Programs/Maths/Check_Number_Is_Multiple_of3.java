 *****  Write an Efficient Method to Check if a Number is Multiple of 3  *****
 
 The very first solution that comes to our mind is the one that we learned in school. If sum of digits in a number is multiple of 3 
 then number is multiple of 3 e.g., for 612 sum of digits is 9 so itâ€™s a multiple of 3. But this solution is not efficient. You have to
 get all decimal digits one by one, add them and then check if sum is multiple of 3.
