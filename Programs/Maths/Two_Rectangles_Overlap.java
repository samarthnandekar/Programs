	Find if two rectangles overlap
	Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not.
	
	Note that a rectangle can be represented by two coordinates, top left and bottom right. So mainly we are given following four coordinates.
	l1: Top Left coordinate of first rectangle.
	r1: Bottom Right coordinate of first rectangle.
	l2: Top Left coordinate of second rectangle.
	r2: Bottom Right coordinate of second rectangle.
	

	Note : It may be assumed that the rectangles are parallel to the coordinate axis.

Given two rectangles R1 and R2 . It is easy to visualize that the given two rectangles can not be intersect if one of the following conditions is true.

Condition 1: When left edge of R1 is on the right of R2's right edge. ( That is , R1 is completely on the right of R2).
Condition 2: When right edge of R1 is on the left of R2's left edge. ( That is , R1 is completely on the left of R2).
Condition 3: When top edge of R1 is on bottom of R2's bottom edge ( That is , R1 is completely under R2).
Condition 4: When bottom edge of R1 is on top of R2's top edge ( That is , R1 is completely over R2).
