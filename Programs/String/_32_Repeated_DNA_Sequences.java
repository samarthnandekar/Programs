 187 LeetCode: Repeated DNA Sequences – Medium
 
 Problem:- All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: “ACGAATTCCG”.
           When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

For example, Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",
Return:["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].
